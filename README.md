# Quick Start
The file `run.sh` can be run to automatically install dependencies, compile all plugins (*USING A PRESET COMMAND),
compile the main and media files, and finally run the dashboard. This is recommended.

# Dev Setup
Install Dependencies

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-image-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

Then, compile main. GCC is assumed.
```
gcc -o anny_board main.c media.c \
  `sdl2-config --cflags --libs` -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_image -lcurl -ldl -lm \
  -lavformat -lavcodec -lavutil -lswscale -lswresample
```

Use each plugin's compile command to compile it into an "so" file.

# Developer Commentary
This application is made using SDL2. Here are some other bullet points:

    -SDL_ttf handles text.
    -I made a custom plugin system, so we load corner tiles from ./plugins/*.so
    -I made the background to just be some low-resolution noise thats upscaled
    -Github contributors are loaded from contributors.txt. Add yourself in a pr.
    -This is designed to run PURELY on linux/x11, MAYBE wayland

## Plugins

If you want to make a plugin, it's pretty easy. Go look at `tile_api.h`. Here are some pointers (badumching):

The main thing you will be doing in your plugin is passing through the following Tile struct:
```

typedef struct Tile {
    int api_version; //this is the api version, so if I mess up and need to update the h file I'm able to track what's updated and more easily figure out what uses the correct Tile and what doesn't
    

    const char* (*name)(void); //name of the tile lmao

    void* (*create)(TileContext *ctx, const char *plugin_dir); //this is the function that will be run when your tile is created
    void  (*destroy)(void *state); //whereas this is the function that will be run when your tile is destroyed (free function, basically)

    void  (*update)(void *state, double dt); //This handles stuff like video frames, it probably won't be necessary for a lot of cases
    void  (*on_show)(void *state); //This is run when your tile is explicitly shown on screen. You can do stuff like change values, see group_of_the_day.c
    void  (*on_hide)(void *state); //This will be run when your tile is not on screen anymore
    void  (*render)(void *state, SDL_Renderer *r, const SDL_Rect *rect); //this is the function to actually render your texture. Don't worry, see the examples that I'm going to talk about soon

    double (*preferred_duration)(void); //the intended duration for the tile to be displayed, with 0 being "i dont care, the system can just pick for me"
} Tile;
```
I've included bonus comments so that you know what everything does

### Sample Plugins
There are many sample plugins for you to base your plugin off of! 
- `image_tile` displays a typical png image
- `video_tile` displays a video, ooh
- `fun_facts` just displays some hardcoded text to the screen
- `group_of_the_day` displays some text which is determined everytime it's shown, it shows off the on_show() functionality.

I can understand making a big thing in C, ESPECIALLY graphics can be daunting, but check out these files if you're worried. You'll definitely be able to figure it out. 

## Controls
I've included some simple keyboard controls for convenience 

- `r`: reloads everything
- `ESC`: quits the program
- `f`: toggles fullscreen
- `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`: toggles the frozen state of a tiles, when a tile is frozen it will not update
